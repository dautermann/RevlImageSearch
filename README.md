# RevlImageSearch

Based on [this code test](CodeTest.md), this app implements Microsoft Image Search and puts it into an attractive collection view that looks great in any orientation and resizes based on screen size (i.e. it's appropriate for iPhones and iPads).

To try it out after cloning, you'll need to do a `pod install` in the same directory folder that has a `Podfile` in it.

Everything within "the initial commit" (or initial 2 commits) was within the four hour time limit given for the project.

## The bonus items in this project include:

A search bar! (in place of the "RevlChallenge" title or navigation bar)
Image caching!

## What I didn't get to do:

Unit testing / UI testing
